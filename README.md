# OpenGL TV Emulator

This is a simple OpenGL simulation of a TV with no antenna reception.

Remember back in the days when you turned on the TV and a weird  gray blinking screen showed up? This simple OpenGL program simulates that noisy image.

# Supported Operating Systems

Currently this code builds as it is on Linux and MACOS. Minor configuration needs to be done to build this project on Windows.
